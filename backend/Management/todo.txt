first clear up back end -> unused mappings, services

think about what kind of services I need for front end
implement back end for the above and the front end calls and display them

connect basic front end to spring -> implement logging in front end

- finish project
- work on UX



list of mappings to provide:
post /user/login -> JWT token
post /user/register
